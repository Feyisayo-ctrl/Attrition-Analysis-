# Attrition-Analysis-
Attrition analysis is crucial for organizations looking to retain talent and reduce turnover costs. Dashboards like this one empower decision-makers with the information they need to proactively address workforce challenges. Whether it’s adjusting compensation, improving workplace policies, or offering age-specific benefits, this analysis provides a solid foundation for action. 
The dashboard is a comprehensive overview of employee attrition, providing valuable insights into workforce dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of the features and insights derived from the dashboard: 
1. Key Metrics at a Glance: 
 - Total Employees: The dataset includes 1,470 employees. 
 - Exited Employees: A total of 237 employees have exited, contributing to an attrition rate of 16.12%. This high-level summary immediately draws attention to the organization’s workforce stability. 

2. Attrition by Gender: 
 The pie chart highlights the gender distribution of employees who have left the organization: 
 - 501 male employees have exited. 
 - 732 female employees have exited. 
 This metric helps in understanding whether attrition is gender-specific or equally distributed. 

3. Hourly Rate Analysis by Gender: 
 The bar chart represents the sum of hourly rates and their variances across genders. This insight helps analyze whether pay discrepancies could correlate with attrition trends. For instance, if a significant variance in hourly rates exists between genders, it might indicate areas for improvement in compensation strategies. 

4. Impact of Age on Employee Retention: 
 The histogram displays attrition trends across various age groups. This analysis helps identify which age groups are most likely to leave the organization, enabling HR teams to devise targeted retention strategies.
